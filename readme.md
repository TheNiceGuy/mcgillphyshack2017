This repo contains our submission to the 2017 McGill Physics Hackathon. This software
implements a small N-body problem solver using verlet integration. We can also
launch a cool rocket from a planet.

# Requirements

* `python 3`
* `python matplotlib`
* `python pyqt4a`
* `python opengl`

# Running

In order to run this software, make sure to install the required dependencies. Then

```
$ cd src
$ ./main.py
```

It is also possible to implement customs planet system. Due to the lack of time, we
couldn't give this functionality to the user. He must code his own system.
